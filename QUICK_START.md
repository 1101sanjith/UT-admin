## 🚨 Important Notes

- **No Backend**: All data is mocked and stored in component state
- **No Persistence**: Refreshing the page resets all data
- **No Real Authentication**: OTP verification is simulated
- **No API Calls**: All operations are UI-only
- **No Database**: Data is hardcoded in TypeScript arrays

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Replace mock data with API calls
2. Implement real authentication
3. Add actual payment gateway integration
4. Connect to a database
5. Add real-time updates
